# FriCAS Customizations and Development
[FriCAS](https://fricas.sourceforge.net/): The coolest CAS tool with types (!)

## Customizations
_These are to help me work better with my FriCAS environment and may not apply directly to you._

- [X] Build script for creating `hsbcl`: SBCL + Hunchentoot Web Server using [QuickLisp](https://www.quicklisp.org/). GitHub commit [here](https://github.com/aravindh-krishnamoorthy/fricas/commit/2b162e5ff8fd766a8f554b151c14ab3c74e5ab79).
- [X] Configure script update to disable HyperDoc by default in FriCAS builds. GitHub commit [here](https://github.com/aravindh-krishnamoorthy/fricas/commit/00eefa980584d339d06cdc6f7fa859391c6c1fcf).

## Community
_These are items being developed together with the FriCAS community._

- [ ] Check if [FriCAS Install Page](https://fricas.github.io/install.html) is up to date and the instructions work

## Development
_These are my private implementations with FriCAS._

- Long-term goal is to develop algebra with matrices as objects and define operations over them, e.g., see derivatives of scalar functions of matrices here: https://www.matrixcalculus.org/.
